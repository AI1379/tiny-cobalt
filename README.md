# Tiny Cobalt

This is a project that implemented a simple C compiler, as an experiment for [Cobalt](https://github.com/The-Cobalt-Develop-Team/cobalt).

## Development

Open the project using VSCode with following extensions:

- cpptools
- xmake
- clangd

Then add `--compile-commands-dir=.vscode` to `clangd.arguments` for clangd to find the `compile_commmands.json` generated by xmake.
